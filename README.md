**[1. V-Dem](https://v-dem.net/vdemds.html)**


>The V-Dem Institute, led by Professor Staffan I. Lindberg, is an independent research institute and the Headquarters of the V-Dem project. The institute is based at the Department of Political Science at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. The Institute is in charge of the operations relating to the data collection and the V-Dem data, including the Country Expert data collection, data curation and making the data available to the users. 

V-Dem Methodology:
>V-Dem’s approach to understanding democratization encompasses multiple core principles: electoral, liberal, majoritarian, consensual, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian. Each Principle is represented by a separate index, and each is regarded as a separate outcome in the proposed study. 

Bayesian Item-Response Theory (IRT):
>It treats experts’ ordinal ratings as imperfect reflections of interval-level latent concepts, and allows for the possibility that experts have different thresholds for their ratings, estimates those thresholds from patterns in the data, and adjusts latent trait estimates accordingly.





**[2. Polity5: Regime Authority Characteristics and Transitions Datasets](http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscrdata.html)**
                  
>Polity5 Project, Political Regime Characteristics and Transitions, 1800-2018, annual, cross-national, time-series and polity-case formats coding democratic and autocratic "patterns of authority" and regime changes in all independent countries with total population greater than 500,000 in 2018 (167 countries in 2018). Polity5 refined data covers mainly the period, 1946-2018; data for years 1800-1945 are Polity IV values.

[**4.Lexicial Index of Electoral Democracy**](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/29106)

>The authors operationalize electoral democracy as a series of necessary-and-sufficient conditions arrayed in an ordinal scale. The resulting Lexical index of electoral democracy (LIED), based partly on new data, covers all independent countries of the world from 1800 to 2013. It incorporates binary coding of its sub-components, which are aggregated into an ordinal scale using a cumulative logic. In this fashion, they arrive at an index that performs a classificatory function, each level identifies a unique and theoretically meaningful regime type, as well as a discriminating function.

These data sets identify states, their standard Correlates of War "country code" or state number (used throughout the Correlates of War project data sets), state abbreviations, and dates of membership as states and major powers in the international system. Version 2016 extends the temporal domain of the collection through December 2016. The Correlates of War project includes a state in the international system from 1816-2016 for the following criteria. Prior to 1920, the entity must have had a population greater than 500,000 and have had diplomatic missions at or above the rank of charge d’affaires with Britain and France. After 1920, the entity must be a member of the League of Nations or the United Nations, or have a population greater than 500,000 and receive diplomatic missions from two major powers.

[**8.Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo and Robinson's Dataset**
](https://economics.mit.edu/faculty/acemoglu/data/ddcg)

>We construct an annual panel that comprises 175 countries from 1960 to 2010, though not all variables
are available for the entire sample. In order to address the issue of measurement error in democracy
indices, we create a consolidated and dichotomous measure of democracy. Following Papaioannou and
Siourounis (2008), our index combines information from several datasets, including Freedom House
and Polity IV, and only considers a country as democratic when several sources classify it as such.

[**9. Boix-Miller-Rosato Dichotomous Coding of Democracy, 1800-2020**](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/FJLMKT)

>This data set provides a dichotomous coding of democracy for every country in the world (222 total) from 1800 to 2020. It updates the original version of our data, which ended in 2007. This version also includes a measure of democracy that requires a level of female suffrage. Please cite the following publication when using the data: Carles Boix, Michael K. Miller, and Sebastian Rosato. 2013. "A Complete Data Set of Political Regimes, 1800-2007." Comparative Political Studies 46(12): 1523-54. (2022-01-03)

[**10. Freedom House - Freedom in the World 2022**](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2022/global-expansion-authoritarian-rule/countries-regions)

> Freedom in the World is produced each year by a team of in-house and external analysts and expert advisers from the academic, think tank, and human rights communities. The 2022 edition involved 128 analysts, and nearly 50 advisers. The analysts, who prepare the draft reports and scores, use a broad range of sources, including news articles, academic analyses, reports from nongovernmental organizations, individual professional contacts, and on-the-ground research. The analysts score countries and territories based on the conditions and events within their borders during the coverage period. Although an element of subjectivity is unavoidable in such an enterprise, the ratings process emphasizes methodological consistency, intellectual rigor, and balanced and unbiased judgments.
