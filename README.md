# Dem-Data-Collection

This collection archives datasets that measure democracy in use in the scholarly literature, which includes V-Dem dataset, Polity5, Freedom House, Geddes, Wright, and Frantz’ autocratic regimes dataset, the Lexical Index of Electoral Democracy, the DD/ACLP/PACL/CGV dataset.

1. V-Dem

The V-Dem Institute, led by Professor Staffan I. Lindberg, is an independent research institute and the Headquarters of the V-Dem project. The institute is based at the Department of Political Science at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. The Institute is in charge of the operations relating to the data collection and the V-Dem data, including the Country Expert data collection, data curation and making the data available to the users. 

V-Dem Methodology:
V-Dem’s approach to understanding democratization encompasses multiple core principles: electoral, liberal, majoritarian, consensual, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian. Each Principle is represented by a separate index, and each is regarded as a separate outcome in the proposed study. 

Bayesian Item-Response Theory (IRT):
It treats experts’ ordinal ratings as imperfect reflections of interval-level latent concepts, and allows for the possibility that experts have different thresholds for their ratings, estimates those thresholds from patterns in the data, and adjusts latent trait estimates accordingly.


2. Polity5

Polity5 Project, Political Regime Characteristics and Transitions, 1800-2018, annual, cross-national, time-series and polity-case formats coding democratic and autocratic "patterns of authority" and regime changes in all independent countries with total population greater than 500,000 in 2018 (167 countries in 2018). Polity5 refined data covers mainly the period, 1946-2018; data for years 1800-1945 are Polity IV values.
